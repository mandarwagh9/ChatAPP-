# Cyber Chat Room

Welcome to the **Cyber Chat Room**! This project is a retro-themed chat application with a cyberpunk vibe. Users can join the chat with a username and send text messages in real-time.

## Features

- **Retro Cyberpunk Theme**: Styled with neon colors and a dark background for a cyberpunk look.
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Users can send and receive messages instantly.
- **Anonymous Chat**: No signup required; just enter a username to join the chat.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling to achieve the retro cyberpunk aesthetic.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality for chat operations and Firebase integration.
- **Firebase**: Backend services for authentication, real-time database, and storage.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Firebase Account**: You need a Firebase account to use Firebase services.
- **Firebase Configuration**: You should have your Firebase project setup with Firestore, Authentication, and Storage.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mandarwagh9/ChatAPP-.git
   cd ChatAPP-
   ```

2. **Create a Firebase Project**

   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Create a new project and add Firestore, Authentication, and Storage.

3. **Update Firebase Configuration**

   - Replace the placeholder Firebase configuration in `script.js` with your own configuration from the Firebase Console.

   ```js
   const firebaseConfig = {
     apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
     authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
     projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
     storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
     messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
     appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
     measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
   };
   ```

4. **Serve the Application**

   You can use a local server to serve the application. If you have `npm` installed, you can use a simple server like `http-server`.

   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   http-server
   ```

   Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or the port displayed) in your web browser to view the chat room.
